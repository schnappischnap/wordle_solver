# wordle_solver
A couple of python scripts to automate a [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) game.<br>
Solves in an average of 3.482 moves, and never takes more than 5 moves.

[autosolver.py](https://github.com/schnappischnap/wordle_solver/blob/master/autosolver.py) uses Selenium to launch a web browser and solves it without any further input (for *maximum* laziness).
